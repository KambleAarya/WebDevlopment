<p>William Blake (28 November 1757 â€“ 12 August 1827) was an English poet, painter, and<br /> printmaker. Largely unrecognised
during his life, Blake is now considered a seminal figure in<br /> the history of the poetry and visual art of the Romantic
Age. What he called his "prophetic<br /> works" were said by 20th-century critic Northrop Frye to form "what is in proportion
to its<br /> merits the least read body of poetry in the English language".[2] His visual artistry led 21st-<br />century critic
Jonathan Jones to proclaim him "far and away the greatest artist Britain has<br /> ever produced".[3] In 2002, Blake was
placed at number 38 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest<br /> Britons.[4] While he lived in London his entire life, except
for three years spent in Felpham,<br />[5] he produced a diverse and symbolically rich collection of works, which embraced the<br />
imagination as "the body of God"[6] or "human existence itself".[7]</p>

<p>Although Blake was considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, he is held in high<br /> regard by later
critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical<br /> and mystical undercurrents within his work. His
paintings and poetry have been characterised<br /> as part of the Romantic movement and as "Pre-Romantic".[8] In fact, he has
been said to be<br /> "a key early proponent of both Romanticism and Nationalism".[9] A committed Christian who<br /> was hostile to
the Church of England (indeed, to almost all forms of organised religion),<br /> Blake was influenced by the ideals and
ambitions of the French and American revolutions.<br />[10][11] Though later he rejected many of these political beliefs, he
maintained an amiable<br /> relationship with the political activist Thomas Paine; he was also influenced by thinkers such<br /> as
Emanuel Swedenborg.[12] Despite these known influences, the singularity of Blake's work<br /> makes him difficult to classify.
The 19th-century scholar William Michael Rossetti<br /> characterised him as a "glorious luminary",[13] and "a man not
forestalled by predecessors,<br /> nor to be classed with contemporaries, nor to be replaced by known or readily surmisable
successors".[14]</p>
